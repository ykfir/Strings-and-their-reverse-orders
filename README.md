# strings_and_their_reverse_order
<<<<<<< HEAD

The script will ask the user to type number of strings (I left it for 4 but it can be change or it can be a variable). Once the user input the final string than the output file would show the user the users' input strings and their correspond reverse order. I did some 'beuatification' to the output file by bold letters some of the lines in order to emphasize the information that follows them.
